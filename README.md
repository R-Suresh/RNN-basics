# RNN's for begginers

This repo is meant to give one and all a simple introduction to RNN's

Click [here](https://dreamtechthefuture.wordpress.com/2018/06/26/rnns-for-noobies/) for the tutorial on my Blog.<br>
The Many to Many RNN ipynb file is a simple RNN model trained on the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset.<br>
Find sample trained models - <br>
1.With pretrained gensim Word Embeddings (WE) [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_a5DlJWkhBckBNusxPzBa8OE05xWaUgo)<br>
2.Without pretrained WE [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N_ADN3CFqRtdomBcMD7wocr3-KVWhwyc)<br>

## Requirements
```
1. Tensorflow = 1.11
2. Keras = 1.11
```

## Running the code
1.Execute ```addition_using_RNN.py``` to run the code for simple addition using RNN<br>
2.Download and run the Many to Many RNN with jupyter<br>
